/*The two methods ‘void fun() const’ and ‘void fun()’ have same signature except that one is const and other is not.
 * Also, if we take a closer look at the output, we observe that, ‘const void fun()’ is called on const object and
 * ‘void fun()’ is called on non-const object.C++ allows member methods to be overloaded on the basis of const type.
 * Overloading on the basis of const type can be useful when a function return reference or pointer.
 *  We can make one function const, that returns a const reference or const pointer, other non-const function,
 *  that returns non-const reference or pointer. */
